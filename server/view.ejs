        <h2>DYBA</h2>
        <p>D'Evelyn Youth Basketball Association is a basketball club that was organized to provide an opportunity for Dennison and current/future Dâ€™Evelyn boys to play together. We have teams from Kindergarten through 8th grade. Kindergartners and 1st graders will likely play in the YMCA league. Our 2nd through 8th grade teams play in the Jefferson County Basketball Conference and our 4th through 8th grade kids may also play in the Gold Crown league. Depending on size and skill level, 1st graders may play in the 2nd grade Jeffco league.</p>
        <p>Our annual membership dues are $30. These funds are used to cover the costs of running the club as well as provide scholarships to players and appreciation gifts to our coaches. You must be a member of the club to play on our teams.</p>
        <p>2017 Team Placement is on Sunday, September 10th. Click on the Registration button to get started. Click on the Team Placement button for this year's schedule.</p>

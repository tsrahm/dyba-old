              <li><u>What is Team Placement?</u></li>
              <li>-Team Placement (aka tryouts) is for placement on competitive and recreational basketball teams that will participate in various leagues throughout the winter.<br>-Teams will be formed for each age group; any player not able to be placed will be referred to other local basketball leagues. While every effort is made to put all players on a team, no guarantee can be made that a player will be placed on a D’Evelyn team.<br>-Players may not tryout for a grade level above without approval.
              </li>
              <br>
              <li><u>Where is the Team Placement held?</u></li>
              <li>-Team Placement takes place at the D'Evelyn High School gym. Please use the entrance on the east side of the building.

              <li><u>How do I register?</u></li>
              <li>-Your DYBA club registration also registers you for Team Placement. Club registration is required. See the <a href="/register.html">Registration</a> page to get started. You must register by Sept 12th in order to get a t-shirt. Club dues are $30.
              </li>
              <br>
              <li><u>How much does this all cost?</u></li>
              <li>-Good question. The answer is , "It depends." All teams, 2nd grade and up, will play in the Jeffco league. Additional fees may include:<br>
              -Gold Crown league fees (If your son's team participates in Gold Crown)<br>
              -Uniform (We typically use the same uniform for 2 years)<br>
              -Gym fees (May be required for practice time for some teams)<br>
              -See the Team Info links by grade for more info on costs
              </li>
              <br>
              <li><u>What if we can't make it to Team Placement?</u></li>
              <li>-You should make every effort to make it to Team Placement. It's an additional burden on the high school coaching staff to properly determine rosters when players do not attend Team Placement.<br>
              -Please send an email to director@develynyouthbasketball.org prior to Team Placement if you cannot be in attendance.<br>
              -<a href="/register.html">Registration</a> is still required!
              </li>
              <br>
              <li><u>What if I have additional questions?</u></li>
              <li>The DYBA director, Tory Rahm, will be available throughout the day during the tryouts. You may also email Tory at director@develynyouthbasketball.org. There will be several volunteers helping out with sign-in for the tryouts. These volunteers are typically experienced basketball parents who can answer most questions. Please be respectful of their time during the busy check-in periods and ask your questions after they've completed check-ins.

              <li><u>What is Team Placement?</u></li>
              <li>-Team Placement (aka tryouts) is for placement on competitive and recreational basketball teams that will participate in various leagues throughout the winter.<br>-Teams will be formed for each age group; any player not able to be placed will be referred to other local basketball leagues. While every effort is made to put all players on a team, no guarantee can be made that a player will be placed on a Dâ€™Evelyn team.<br>-Players may not tryout for a grade level above without approval.
              </li>
              <br>
              <li><u>Where is the Team Placement held?</u></li>

              <li>-There will be several parent Q&A sessions. See the <a href="/team-placement.html">Team Placement</a> page for the schedule. Parents new to the program and those with boys who are newly eligible for Gold Crown (5th grade and up) are encouraged to attend...all are welcome.

              <li><u>How do I register?</u></li>
              <li>-Your DYBA club registration also registers you for Team Placement. Club registration is required. See the <a href="/register.html">Registration</a> page to get started. You must register by Sept 12th in order to get a t-shirt. Club dues are $30.
              </li>
              <br>
              <li><u>How much does this all cost?</u></li>
              <li>-Good question. The answer is , "It depends." All teams, 2nd grade and up, will play in the Jeffco league. Additional fees may include:<br>
              -Gold Crown league fees (If your son's team participates in Gold Crown)<br>
              -Uniform (We typically use the same uniform for 2 years)<br>

              </li>
              <br>
              <li><u>What if we can't make it to Team Placement?</u></li>
              <li>-You should make every effort to make it to Team Placement. It's an additional burden on the high school coaching staff to properly determine rosters when players do not attend Team Placement.<br>
              -Please send an email to director@develynyouthbasketball.org prior to Team Placement if you cannot be in attendance.<br>
              -<a href="/register.html">Registration</a> is still required!
